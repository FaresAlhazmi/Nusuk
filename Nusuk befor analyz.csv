0,Owais Ahmed,"Update: It's better now and I was able to use it to book Umrah, which I performed yesterday. HOWEVER, it does stop working and close at random times, and this can be when you need to show it. The good news is that the permit appears in Tawakkalna, so you can show that wherever needed. After updating this app yesterday, I can barely use it. It keeps stopping/closing shortly after starting it. This needs to be fixed. No other program on my phone behaves like this."
1,Mohamed Omar,"I was working OK at the beginning. After getting updates, I have problems: 1- The app stopped showing available times for Umrah and I can't book it. 2- The app is sending reminder messages for already past events and booking that I have already utilized. I tries two solutions: * I logged off and logged on again but the problems persist. * I uninstalled and reinstalled the app but the same problems still there. I hope it will be fixed or provide a guidance. I hope this will be fixed soon."
2,Miranda Gazingstar,"Creating my account with all correct entered data but during log in, it always show 'data incorrect', redo again with the same correct details yet cant log in. Uninstall&reinstall the apps, reset my password and email yet still the same, and decided to call Help Centre + providing the 'Data Error' code, they promise to solve the issue within 3-4 hour or 24 hour, but after a days of my report it still unresolved. üò©üò©üò©ü§≤ü§≤üôèüôè"

6,Wahaj Mubeen,"It's a good effort by Saudi gov but user experience is totally flawed. I spent more than 1 hour but couldn't issue an umrah permit, tried on 3 devices for 3 accounts. It says that I already have a permit but there is actually no permit. Error messages are wrong plus add a search bar in countries list please."
7,khawaja Saad,"Its useless to have this app when the people standing there at gate dont allow you to enter even you show them the permission issued via app into the mosque just because you are not into the group. They should separate the timming for groups and individuals, but once your timming is allocated no one is allowed to stop you. They are answerable to ALLAH ALMIGHTY as we are travelling from different countries and facing it."
8,mohammed Raiyaan,"Very irritating,had the worst experience we where trying for weeks for the approval of rowdah and it didn't even work.we came individually as for for umrah we need this app we got the approval but for rowdah we didn't get the approval. It would be good if the app was not there and the old system would come back there will be no held backs and sometimes we don't even get the chance . My experience worst."
9,Mohammad Arbaz Parihar,"While registering it shows 1001006 error, I have tried :- 1. Installing/Uninstall the app. 2. To register from other phones. 3. To register with mobile data / WiFi Its been more than 2 weeks since I've been trying and there's no improvement in the app. Disappointed üòû."

Not at all advisible 2- I missed my slot because I reached at MADINAH MUNAWWARAH late but there was no chance to cancel the slot , that's why I didn't get the chance to inter Rouza from my login. 3- No system of online checking, when you people giving slot online then why are you allowing people to enter manually."

75,Hasnain Ahmed,Some error occurs in this application I can't select city of residence. Please sort it ASAP
76,Farhan,Regulating the entry of thousands of people to a small space like Rawdah by using an app is just unreasonable. Less people will get the chance of entering a place that they can probably only visit once in their lifetime. If themeparks can regulate people queueing then why those people in the military uniform can't?

On the other hand my family who is on a visit visa, different phone with data registration, I successfully booked for umrah 3 times and there are always empty slots. So it's not about crowd or already booked. It's about coding the app correctly. Developers should look into it."
138,Rashid Chandna,"Nice app. Initially, the only problem people face and give 1 star is the problem that it must have same password as in Tawakkalna. This is not mentioned anywhere and people got confused about the error. Further, it must allow multiple bookings with reasonable gap between as per policy to plan for future visits. After update on 2020-11-09 on setting buttons doesn't show the options and app quits, so nobody can logout and login again. This is a serious bug and should be solved immediately."
139,Mohammed Noorgat,Terrible. My app is frozen. I reinstalled and still. Got permits on my wife's paid for transport from my one before 2 hrs but permits were still canceled. No one answers the call center. Tried 8 times. Help this is a nightmare and stressful. Also if we do not need transport why is this not an option. We book a hotel so why do we need a bus. Help develop a better app. This one is a fail.
140,Adila Zanal Abidin,Thank you so much for the wonderful and pleasant experience using this app. We hope you continue to remain absolutely useless so that pilgrims from abroad cannot use it all. Why even bother creating apps without fixing the bugs and system crash? An app designed and created to test our patience it is. Truly remarkable! Hopefully in future we don't need this app at all
141,Reem Zaqout,"Everything is fine until they send the OTP, my phone number is mentioned without the country code and when I try to add it on the number itself it doesnt accept it, it said reach out to support but there's no option to reach out to them.. i tried multiple times I'm no longer allowed to register!!!"
142,mobasher akram,"I would give 0 stars if you could. Set up an account which then was permanently locked for some reason. Couldn't log in again after. What's worse was the lack of support and understanding from the officials. Visited the help centre by gate 34 who were completely useless and asked me to phone the I.T helpline who were equally useless and told me to, ""try it at different times of the day and it may work."" This didn't help.. at all. Tried speaking to the gate masters who were equally useless."
143,Enas Bit Adil,"The app is mostly not working, poor designs at some version, specially older version and big screens, the app is not responsive and the auto rotation is deactivated, when you try to login after sign up your information it says ""the data is incorrect"" even though the data is all correct and double checked. Sadly I didn't know how hard and complicated it is to meet the prophet of Islam. Maybe in Jannah Inshallah"
144,Umair Nasir,"Very bad experience of my life. No option is working every time it open it says update and then no option works. Can't update mobile number or personal information it crashes all the time. Can't update companion, it crash down. It need lots of changes and please hire developers who know how to develop app."
145,Shakil Ahmed,"The new update that came on 24 Dec is horrendous as app crashes before even opening. Me and my wife both updated to the new versions on 2 different phones and have uninstalled/reinstalled several times but it crashes before even opening! I am in Medina now, drove 500 kms and now this app is not working, so can not really take any appointments. Terribly disappointed!"
146,MRR Qureshi,"Very bad App specially when it comes to user experience evaluation, the process does not complete even after several attempts in several days... And interestingly you can not move forward to use app unless you pass through that survey... Everytime you reach at FINISH it gives Internal Server Error."
147,Faiz Thalib,"I spent several hours trying to figure out what was the issue with the app. Called the app hot line and technical support was not able to help. Eventually, I walked into 1 of the offices outside Masjid Nabawi, Gate 352 and the lady behind the counter solved the issue immediately. Apparently, this app works better on non Android phones, which explains why my app kept crashing when I tried to reset password. She helped reset the password on her phone and everything is fine now, alhamdulillah."
148,Ibnu Hamka,I can't log in after the update....i had miss my raudhahüò≠üò≠ so i have to book it after 30 daysüò≠üò≠..please help me and fix this issue
149,s bhuiyan,"The App has no significance, the Saudi guards/police does not even bother to look at apps, they only allow groups with approved papers, others diverted to exits."
150,Saudah Saad,"So many time filled up my data still told incorrect but data are correct. Very disappointed with this apps. When to update email, still incorrect. When to reregister. Told already registered. When to login. Told incorrect data. But cannot to be delete account. Because unsuccess login. Very bad experience to apply to Rawdah."
151,Shaimaa El Morshedy,"After installing, app crashes and I can' t relogin. Clear cache and reinstall app don't solve the problem"
152,Ishaq Resosumito,"Useless app, after update app cannot open. Show error msg. Developer pls look into this ASAP as tomorrow i have raudah booking & Umrah the next."
153,Usman Najmal,Unable to get OTP for email varification .. Time is running out .. And am keep trying.. Please do sort this .. It really give us mental agony
154,Hamed Kakar,"I booked umrah for me and my family next Saturday the 28th November. After this I couldn't open the app, it was requesting me to update it. Once I updates it, the new app shows that I have no active permits and it keeps crashing. This is a lie and must be fixed. I planned my trip and now all my planning has gone to waste. Thanks."
155,Noridayu Othman,Tried a few times to login. But the application keep crashing. Updated the app today
156,Eng. Arshad Rashid,Working good after an update and change Name
157,Masuma Noorani,I can't log into the app. It says there is a bug. What do I do and how do I access my appointment for the Rawda prayers. Pls fix!
158,Noha Nafee,It asked for update. Once I updated the app broke entirely & crash. Cannot retrieve anything
159,Wasif Umar,"After update the app it was crashing, but the problem is resolved if you uninstall the app and install it again"
160,haifaa gasim,Not working. Not accepting verification code.
161,Suraya Hussain Suraya Hussain,Poor... need to upgrade the for better performance. Lot of time wasted by trying to open and login
162,Khu Az,"Awful experience. Trying since yesterday to get permit of Rawda but the app keep giving glitches. It is not showing any month nor date. Where as my sis was able to. I uninstalled, reinstalled the app, tried everything but nothing is working. My whole family and friends got it except me. PLEASE FIX THE APP. People travel from all over the world for Umrah and visit Rawdah & Riaz ul Jannah. The glitches of app and it not working properly is making the whole process very difficult."
163,Shah Syed,There must be another way of booking like a desktop version or direct website. After paying hefty visa fees and other costs the travelers deserve something better. The developer knows the issues and intentionally not fixing it is pathetic. Nothing is booked and travel dates are approaching. Don't even deserve 1 star but that's the minimum we have to give to post this.üëéüëé
164,Shahid Nabi,"Not able to login. I tried to register on this app but it says account already exists. Which in the first place isn't true. However, I try to request for forgot password and they are showing some unknown mobile number linked to my profile, which adds misery to my already frustrated mind. Please try to fix it ASAP. Provide some contact number where app developer can be reached to solve the issue. Thanks.."
165,Muhammad Fahad Khalid Siddiqui,date selection method is very tough ÿµÿπÿ® ÿ¨ÿØÿß. months should change by swapping. always select again and again. and it does not remember last selection. there should also a current date button to reset selection to current month.
166,Talal Alhamoud,"Even though it is a good gesture to have such an organizing application but the service is so poor, couldn't find any slot for umrah since two weeks even though I'm checking the application hourly. Tried to call the phone number and all what i get is a suggestion to keep looking for vacancy in the application."
167,Z H,"Hating it.This app made my life hell.am a british citizen and booked my flight and hotel ,arrived in S Arabia and got my e visa on arrival with umrah included like it was advertised ,it helped people like us who hardly get time off work .but to my surprise in the 8 days visit i cant get a slot for umrah and praying in riyad ul janah.App has no slots available.this App made it impossible for visitors,was better be4,que and go in.no need to book in advance.i HATE this app.plus my mom dont use phon"
168,Afshan Yunas,Such a petty tat the app has so many bugs. Keeps on crashing n doesn't allow to add kids as companions for guardian
169,Asmatullah Zubair,App is giving me this error. 10005019 You already have an active permit. But i have not issued permit using nusuk app.
170,Fatima Riaz,"Disappointed, app is only showing 7 days in while month available for umrah in Mecca and 7 in Madinah. My travel dates not even match with that. Dont know what to do....spent so much on Umrah booking"
171,Aseel Alkubaisi,"Great disappointment with this application let's start with 1) not an easy process to register 2) u can't add any of the family member to your page 3) the application main goal was to ease the way for the people to come inside rawdha with an appointment right? This is the main outfall of the application as u can't book your visit by date or time, it can show u only the day that u r in and for some reason page stayed freezed without any clue. Needs improvement urgently"
172,Qaiser Khokhar,"Dear App developers, thank you for giving opportunity to Muslims to Perform Umrah. But, it must be simple and easy to book. I got initial reservation one hour ago. I paid for transportation 2 times from different cards but still no purchased transport is appearing in my account and one hour is left for initial reservation to auto cancel. Please, make the life of Muslims easy. Please. Please. Please. Now after 2 hours, permit canceled automatically. Though I paid for transportation twice."
173,fathima jasat,What has happened? After an upgrade this app has become a nightmare. Booking transport is crazy. Try to call help and support and no one answers after 8 mins call ends. I booked got a permit. Paid before 2 hrs were up but my permit was still cancelled. Who to call or email since no response either way. Please sort this out. Also how come there is no option for no transport. We have our own car. No need to take a bus since we book a hotel close by. Help! Help! Make it easy to use.
174,Hasham Khan,"Updated on 7th march, app is not crashing anymore, just in time for my next saudi visit in 3 days Crashes on huawei android 10. Tried sending them an emailnto report this bug but their email is incorrect and gets a failure delivery email. Habe to borrow iphone for umra as this app works on iphone only."

177,Adnan Hanif,I open the app it is automatically immediately close. Update the app and also reinstall it but still this is happening. I could not add my companion or used app for permits. Kindly tell me why this is happening what could be the reason. Please fix the issue. Thanks
178,Akm Faroque,This app is only for people who are alert and have lot of free time to try continuously. Others cannot book. This app doesn't provide a level playing field. A person who has not performed Umrah for long time should get high priority for booking appointment. Always the app displays NO DATE. Some people say the app opens only for few minutes at 12 pm & somebody says it opens the date at 3 pm Thursday. The app to be successful should receive the bookings & give appointments based on some priority.
179,Brahim Souli,"It is working, just go to app info, storage and clear data and cache"
180,Faraz Khan,App is good.. but now m trying book slot for medina.. there is no single day available...I have doubt its app issue or don't know what..

183,Qussay Firon,"It must have 0 stars, after entering the verification code it says not matching always."
184,Musadiq Mohiuddin,The app is not working properly for reservation of hajj as i am trying from few days not able to register myself kindly look in the matter and rectify asap thanks
185,Anum hanif,"This app doesn't work at all not showing countries so I can save my country name, doesn't show area code so I can add my phone number, too slow to use or make an ID, not working properly I have been trying to make new ID so I can use this app while performing ummrah and Hajj but I don't think so this app gonna work."
186,Asma Raffat,Passcode which we received and input on the app says incorrect number entered. Please advise what went wrong.
187,Shazia Ahmed,"Assalaamu'alikum, The App was working fine initially for booking prayer visits to haram, Alhamdulillah. But it also had some technical issues in the middle where it wasn't allowing bookings for prayers. I am also not able to get a booking for Umrah at all since I got the App. And now after updating the app it keeps crashing. This is really not good, please kindly fix the issue asap In shaa Allah!"

191,Kash Miri,First time user. Android version doesn't work. Selected myself then the page appears about booking transport. It seems the page is not scrolling and therefore doesn't allow me to make any further selection. Please fix this. I've already paid for the transportation. You should do a proper test of these apps before making it available to the public. Remember you are already taking people's money for an act of worship that your app doesn't work. Please fix it.
192,khalid Omran,application is not working for hajj services
193,syed iqbal,"Its too much crowded, very hard to access. I tried so many times but I am not able to access my profile settings. It closes each time I pressed the setting button. If you can help me let me know."
194,Hamza Baig,Nothing works. The app keeps crashing whenever you click on settings and you cannot book umrah as it takes more than one min to load. The developer must give an update as soon as possible.
195,Syed Ali,"Diabolical app! What are they thinking. Anyone outside Saudi can't book companions (people they are travelling with) on the app which means eveyones has to have a phone with access to mobile data. The functionality is there, its just disabled. It also has 2FA everytime you log in. Also you cant register a child with your phone number or email as this also needs to be unique. A ridiculously over engineered app for simple access to the mosques."
196,Youssouf Eusman,"After the update, the app works ineffectively, which makes it very difficult to book a service. Besides that, I cannot see my valid permits and it seems that it disappears after app got updated."
197,Bismillah Saudi,I have a account in nusuk app but i cant Login because i forgot my password And my sim number is not working. Please help me to to login to nusuk application with my iqama number

202,Mohamed AriF' uddin Siddiqi,Etamarna application is Crashing and suddenly stops working. After the last update in June..its still Crashing and Stops working. Kindly update to the latest version to make sure we perform Umrah. Thanks in advance. With Best regards
203,Muhammad Hashmi,Very hard to use this app. Pls make it easy for all Muslims. Now a days corona finish. We need easy prayer.
204,sirmad hasan,"When registering, it asks for OTP which is sent on my email id. Despite entering the correct OTP, it does not proceed forward. Says incorrect details. I tried 4 times and still no progress. The app is useless"
205,Dr. Noura Semary,"Good application. Very limited chances. Sometimes gives fake dates. When check the reservations, there is no way to return back to the main screen!! Hope to resolve this bug."
206,Abdullah Al Fahad,"The App owner MUST work on crashing issue. It is bothering me a lot. If you cannot use the tool in time of your need, then what's the point of having the tool anyway?!"
207,Mohamad Al Sabban,"The application is good, but after the latest update it keeps crashing when you open it, it urgently needs an update, I had this issue for almost a month and they still didint fix it!"
208,Kareemullah Sheik,It was working great but as I updated the version yesterday Iam unable to check or book the slots. The continue button does not seem to work though it is enabled. Please check urgently as I want to book a slot. Thanks.

210,Urooba asad,App crashing constantly.
211,Usman Khalid,They saw the app and ask me to go out side. I have waited for manu days. Lots of peples wait for lot of days but they refuse the application of nusuk and let us go out of the line. Tootly failures of the govt. We have spent lots of money and travel tousands of KM. They treat like goats and lambs...totly disappointed
212,Ahmed Foula,Can not cancel the umrah permission .. no option to cancel
213,Hammad Abdul-Rasheed,It's 25th of march but still not showing itikhaf registration option yet....

224,Muhd Khidhir,"I am unable to go beyond the verification. However, I do applaud the effort for this app. For those facing the same error 10010016, its likely because your phone android version is higher than 10. I know of ppl with no issue with android version 10."
225,MK,"This app gave a really really hard time with getting permits. I recommend either fix the bugs or have a work around so that people can get access to Rawdah, perform Umrah and perform prayers. P.S. The staff at Rawdah was very rude in spite of them knowing the app did not work on some phones to get permits! This is a spiritual journey, please make it pleasant and memorable. Thanks."
226,Shofiqun Nessa,Internal server problem that's all I encounter while trying to register. I've tried deleting the app and reinstalling it and still same issues. No doubt they've paid billions for some Americans to develop it. Useless!!!

I booked for Umrah but I enetered and nobody asked or stopped me. I also booked for praying at Rawdah but the guard did not let me enter due to reaching the full capacity. THEN WHY WASTING YOUR MONEY FOR THIS USELESS APP !!!!!"

234,Mohammed Yaseen,"Assalamu alaikkum, Everyone who is facing issue with the ""continue"" button on Umrah, there is a solution on Android devices. Go to settings of your mobile, under Apps, search for Eatmarna and clear the data under storage option. After clearing the data, restart the application and log in. Hopefully it will work In sha Allah. For Apple users, I believe there will be something equivalent to clearing the app data in their system too."

259,Musa'b Uddin,So good intention behind developing this app to ease umrah bookings for every individual but extremely poor service ....never shows available dates for anything. And it is mandatory to book using this such a poor functioning app. Very bad . Total disappointment!
260,Google User,"Crashes a lot, never ever works when you reach the check point in Haram for the security to see your permits and you will see ppl piling up there stuck for the same, and their justification is the load is high too many checking at the same time! Well if you build an app to issue access permits to Omara and prayers in a very specific time wouldn't make sense that it will be checked and used in that same specific time! The solution to this problem dump this app and use Tawakkalna to show permits"
261,Asma Ashraf,The app gets closed as soon as opened after the update... please fix it.. (Update 13.09.2021) I'm currently facing a problem with appointments for Rawdah women...

264,abdulbasit pervez,"After update, when I try to login, app shuts down"
265,Faheem,"Complete rubbish. Good luck trying to get to the rowdah with this thing in your way. It's a 'little' weird that I have to get a nusuk permit to pray in a literal piece of heaven on earth. But even then, at least make the app work!"

The issue is that we are not receiving OTP on our mobile phones as a result of a quality assurance failure. If the server sends OTP to a mobile phone number that does not have a country code, the consumer will not get OTP until the fault is fixed. If we can't acquire an OTP, your customer won't be able to log in, and if he can't log in, what's the point of having this app."

People across the globe majorly speak English so please be at par. Value their efforts, time and money."

469,Muhammad Waqas,It is not showing nationality and country codes drop downs to register new user. Application loading is very slow. Why are you ristricting vistors to get permit from this app when you've implemented the biggest flopped system in the world.

474,Hamed Khan,Nice app. No problem. All working good. Not sure why people are making so many negative comments. For safety I would advice carrying 2 phone when going for umrah.
